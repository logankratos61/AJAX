# AJAX 

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

Classic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the content should change.

Examples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and Facebook tabs.

=> AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:
  1.XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)
  2.JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)
  3.CSS (to style the data)
  4.XML (often used as the format for transferring data)
  
  ==>  Ajax is not a programming language or a tool, but a concept. Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh.
